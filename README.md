# SnapSwap

## 1. Introduction

### Brief Description
**SnapSwap** is an innovative open-source tool designed to simplify and automate the process of transferring volume snapshots between teams on DigitalOcean. Born out of the specific challenges faced in managing volume snapshots across different teams, SnapSwap streamlines the procedure, minimizing manual intervention and maximizing efficiency.

### Motivation
While DigitalOcean offers a robust set of features, transferring volume snapshots between teams wasn't one of them, at least as of 2022. DigitalOcean users frequently found themselves needing to share snapshots across teams but were faced with a cumbersome process. SnapSwap was created to bridge this gap, providing a solution that is both quick and easy to implement.

## 2. Features

- **Automated Snapshot Transfer**: Reduce manual steps and potential errors by automating the transfer of volume snapshots between DigitalOcean teams.
  
- **Integration with Popular IaC Tools**: Designed to seamlessly integrate with infrastructure as code tools such as Terraform and configuration management tools like Ansible, making it a versatile solution for diverse infrastructures.
  
- **User-Friendly**: SnapSwap aims to offer an intuitive user experience, making snapshot transfers straightforward even for those not deeply familiar with DigitalOcean's internals.

## 3. Prerequisites

Before diving into SnapSwap, ensure you have the following:

- **DigitalOcean API Tokens**: API tokens for both the source and target teams are essential. These tokens provide SnapSwap the necessary permissions to manage and transfer snapshots.

- **Environment Setup**: Familiarity with DigitalOcean's environment, especially in terms of volume and snapshot management.

- **Tool Dependencies**: SnapSwap is designed to work seamlessly with specific infrastructure tools. As such, you must have:
  - **Packer**: Used to automate the build process of the intermediary DigitalOcean Droplet.
  - **Terraform**: Responsible for orchestrating the resource creation in the target team.
  - **Ansible**: Manages the data transfer and volume setup on the Droplets.

Ensure all three tools are installed and properly configured to make full use of SnapSwap.
